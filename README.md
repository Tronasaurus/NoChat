# NoChat

An addon to enforce self-muting for those of us that can't seem to shut the fuck up and keep our shitty opinions and abuse to ourselves.

### Features:
- Blocks almost all outgoing and inbound messages.
- Allows Guild Chat and Battle.net Whispers
- Alerts on /s and /w from other players.


### Known issues:
- Doesn't allow for easy player reporting from chat if you do receive an unwanted message.
- Some spam from global channels such as General, Trade and LFG. (Note: Just leave them if you're using this addon, you won't be able to use them anyway.)

### Installation:
1. Download and unzip into your `_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns` folder.
2. Make sure the folder is named `NoChat`.
3. Restart the game or type `/reload` in chat.

No configuration needed â€” it just works!
